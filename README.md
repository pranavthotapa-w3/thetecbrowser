# 🚀 TEC Browser: The Infinite Command Center

**TEC Browser** is a high-performance, **Chromium-based** powerhouse designed to be the ultimate cockpit for your digital life. While traditional browsers treat every user the same, TEC is built on the principle of **Radical Modularity**, allowing you to dismantle and rebuild your interface to match your exact workflow. By fusing world-class AI with a mobile-optimized social core, TEC Browser eliminates the friction of context switching and tab fatigue forever.

## 🧠 The Triple-Threat AI Integration

TEC Browser is the first web environment to treat AI as a native utility rather than a third-party add-on. We don't force a single "assistant" on you; we give you the keys to the entire kingdom.

* **Native LLM Support:** Seamlessly toggle between **ChatGPT (OpenAI)**, **Gemini (Google)**, and **Claude (Anthropic)**.
* **API-First Architecture:** Simply plug in your own **API keys**. This ensures maximum privacy (your data stays with the provider, not the browser) and gives you access to the latest models (such as GPT -4 or Claude 3.5 Sonnet) at wholesale prices.
* **AI Smart-Sidebar:** Summarize long research papers, generate complex code snippets, or draft high-impact emails in a persistent side panel that stays open while you browse.

## 🛠️ Radical Modularity: Custom UI & Layouts

Why settle for a static top-bar? In TEC Browser, every major UI element is a movable block.

* **Dynamic Tab Management:** Move your tab bar to the **Top, Bottom, Left, or Right**. Vertical tabs allow for better readability of site titles, while bottom tabs offer a mobile-friendly ergonomic feel.
* **Movable Sidebars:** Snap your productivity tools to either side of the screen.
* **Multi-Account Selector:** A dedicated, floating selector for managing different **Google, Microsoft, or Social profiles**. Switch from "Work Mode" (Drive/Gmail/Asana) to "Personal Mode" (TikTok/Insta/Personal Gmail) with a single click.
* **Chromium Core:** Since it's built on Chromium, you get the speed of the Blink engine and 100% compatibility with every extension in the **Chrome Web Store**.

## 📱 The Mobile-Web Hybrid Sidebar

TEC Browser brings the best of mobile efficiency to the desktop. Our sidebar isn't just a list of links—it's a fully functional **App Environment**.

* **Social Pulse:** Native, vertically-optimized windows for **TikTok and Instagram**. Scroll your FYP or reply to DMs without ever opening a new tab or picking up your phone.
* **Google Workspace Pro:** Pre-integrated shortcuts for **Google Drive, Gmail, and Calendar**. Your files and schedule are always visible in a thin, non-intrusive strip.
* **Custom App Overlays:** Add any website to your "Apps Bar" via the customize menu. These apps can be launched as **interactive overlays**—semi-transparent floating windows that sit on top of your current page. Perfect for keeping a YouTube video, a calculator, or a Discord chat open while you work on a main document.

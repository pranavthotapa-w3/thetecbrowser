# thetecbrowser
Thetecbrowser's layout is defined by its flexibility. Built on the Google Chromium engine for maximum speed and extension compatibility, the UI is entirely modular. You have the freedom to position the tab bar on the top, bottom, or sides, and you can relocate the sidebar and multi-account selector to match your personal ergonomic preferences.
